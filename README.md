## Setup

### Developer:
Simply navigate to your dashboard at [http://vorlondebugger.azurewebsites.net/dashboard/default](http://vorlondebugger.azurewebsites.net/dashboard/default). This is your dashboard for viewing who
is currently on the Vorlon demo site.

### Users:
Instruct them to navigate to [http://vorlondemoapp.azurewebsites.net/](http://vorlondemoapp.azurewebsites.net/), which is a basic
HTML5 boilerplate site.


## Usage
Look at your dashboard, and you'll now see that the users are viewing the page. You can alter their code on-the-fly.
